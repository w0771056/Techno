Did the beginning jazz for a while, however i have been having troubles getting a database to inititate.
I realized that I already had instances of the same name Databases on the server already. 
I then found myphp.admin so I could control the databases on the server that I have created.
So far I have contributed at least 2 - 3 weeks of work failing to realize that the Instances of Databases I have
already created were causing problems. I am going to try to create Crud files with views....
I have tried changing things around, and trying to create my Database, and crud files any way possible.
At this point I have barely accomplished anything in this project. Sorry Andrew :(...
I worked really hard to solve my problem, and completed the assignment as asked. Thanks for 
all your support.
